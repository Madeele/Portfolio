            <p class="details_text"><b>Problem statement:</b></p>
            <p class="problem">Salvatio Push start-up created a device that saves people lifes by sending messages with help request in case of danger. Just with one button click every person can be sure, that someone will come and give help if needed. <br><br> The problem was, that to have the device fully working, Salvatio Push also needed an app that will be the easiest thing to use by all the customers. It has a basic design but it wasn't adjusted for the target group and it was missing a lot of funcionalities:<br><br> - Notifications in the app<br>
                - Settings<br>
                - Profile page<br>
                - Map with potential needy people<br><br>
            There was also a huge lack of information of how the app works and what are the rules of payments, which is a basic for the client to understand, before using the App.</p>

            <p class="details_text"><b>PROCESS </b></p>
            <p class="details_text"><b>Before creating every project final solution, I'm making a full desk and field research. As I focus on design and web development fields in my portfolio, I'm not attaching this parts of the process down below.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="details_text">Salvatio Push start-up had it own logo before I joined the team, that set the color palette for me for the whole prototype creating process. I started with making a <b>Style-tile</b>, so CEO could see and agree on what to do further  and what steps I'll take soon. I took the blue color from logo as a main one and created a gradiend to give it some more depth.<br><br>To fill the design with some additional color, I decided on grey tone for boxes in the App.
            </p>
            <img src="img/salvatio-style.png" class="mockup_center">
            <p class="details_text">In the beggining I got some screens of the App that previous designer created, but I found it to crowdy and full of elements that makes it unreadable. Colors were pourly chosen for the background as well as for some elements.<br><br> My main thought was that the interface of the App has to be as easy as for the child, because of the <b>main target group - eldery people and women</b>. When Wojciech joined the project, we agreed on using some icons and making the app more visual and intuitive.

            <p class="problem">While making a Concept test with our fellow students, we tried to get the knowledge about the Events Apps in Aarhus (If there are any? What they offer? What is missing?) We asked around 10 people about their opinion on this topic. It came out that Facebook is their only option and they really hate it. It's very difficult to understand Facebook events' flow and find specific event that interest our user. <br><br>We asked them what is the most important for them in finding an event and they answered: <br><br> 1.Distance <br>2.Date <br>3.How many friends are attending<br><br>The other problem was how difficult it is to find releavant information about the event and find the exact category that interest you. </p>

            <p class="details_text"><b>Before creating every project final solution, I'm making a full desk and field research. As I focus on design and web development fields in my portfolio, I'm not attaching this parts of the process down below.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="details_text">To start the design part, we firstly have to set up a base and the whole foundation, so every member of the group will know which colors we are going to use or how our buttons will look like.
            We already wanted to also agree on the fonts for headings and normal text for our solution, not to spend a lot of time on searching for it later.Everyone of us had a task to search for some inspirations that we want to use while creating our own project, so we gathered some mobile solutions to make an agreement on one style.<br><br>
            For creating those foundations, we prepared a graphical visualization of what we have in our mind in the Style-tile.
            </p>
            <img src="img/gatherstyle.png" class="mockup_center">
            <p class="details_text">Thanks to wireframes, we got a layout for all the elements that we wanted to implement and as we didn’t have a lot of sketches, these wireframes were really important for our UX quality. We spend a lot of time discussing where to put some boxes or how to construct pages that we need. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/gatherwire.png" class="mockup_center">
            <p class="details_text">Then there was a perfect time to use our style-tiles and create mockups that we will also use later as the prototype. We made an AB testing to find out if we should use pictures in our ‘Events’ or only a color. Images came out to be more interesting for our users so our decision was even more supported as we would have to many colors on pages. We used our base colors for creating decorations and Logo for 2Gather App as well as buttons and categories boxes.

            <p class="details_text"><b>CODING </b></p>
            <p class="details_text">The main focus in this project was placed on the Single Page Application layout of our website and usage of JavaScript. We had few main functionalities in our Web App that I would like to highlight:<br>
                •	Events ordered by 3 properties (date, distance and friends attending).<br>
                •	Search bar that gives content filtered by name of the event.<br>
                •	Categories that are dividing the events e.g. ‘music’, ‘party’.<br>
                •	Log-in through Facebook and E-mail, that enables welcoming a user with his name and displaying his e-mail in profile page.<br><br>
                
                Let me start right away with describing some examples of the code that I was responsible for.
            </p>
            <img src="img/code1.png" class="mockup_center">
            <p class="details_text">To append our events, I used the <b>filter() method</b> placed inside of the onSnapshot() method, so we would get all the updates from <b>Firestore</b> in real time. I created a new array that will hold filtered events based on the value that user will put into search bar input. Then I appended events that consist of the written value by appendCategories() function which we created and used before. I had to play more with the code as I wanted to show ‘Categories’ again if the array won’t contain searched value, so I created an ‘if else’ function that checks if the value consists of searched elements, and If doesn’t – it runs a function that shows the categories and search bar again and hides a section with filtered events. 
            </p>
            <img src="img/code2.png" class="mockup_center">
            <p class="details_text">As I was also responsible for user authorization through Facebook and Email, I spend a lot of time on reading docs and getting the knowledge about appending current user data to our code. I managed to get current user name and email, as well as profile FB picture in some cases. Maybe it doesn’t look difficult on the screenshot, but it took tones of time and focus to understand the “permissions” on Facebook developers page and the work of id’s of every user. After hours of understanding the whole process, it came out that the code for it is just so simple as you can see above.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="details_text"><b>Problem statement:</b></p>
            <p class="problem">After talking with our Client - Travelday, we knew that our users weren't held on the website due to lack of personal connection to it. They haven’t felt that they need to come back to the website that doesn't create personal values for them. There is no option of creating the profile, nor saving your searches or adding to favorites anything that you found interesting.<br><br>

                World has no barriers for us right now so travel providers and agencies has to stand out to be known and recognizable, as there is a wide range of all kinds of travel companies that wants to get our attention. That’s how the first question appeared in our minds :<br><br>
                
                    • What’s unique about Travelday and their solution, how are they different from their competitors?<br><br>
                    
                If there is so many travel providers, how exactly we can achieve this goal knowing that we are searching among two target groups that Ralu will tell you more about in further chapters. As we are aiming for Generation Z and Millennials, we have to somehow make them more aware of websites that give a true value for their users. But how to make Travelday one of them? Here the next question was born :<br><br>
                
                    •   How can we best create awareness and interest among the target groups of Generation Z and Millennials – and what are they interested in?  <br><br>
                
                Thinking about awareness we could automatically head toward traffic for Travelday website, solution or maybe even social media? All the triggers for coming back to the websites are created by need of achievements or human addictions/behavior so in our solution we also have to think:<br><br>
                
                    • How  can we increase the traffic for Travelday's solution/website/social media and make users stay there and even come back later? <br><br>
                    
                As the last thing after all our questions and brainstorming we also had to think about how to implement and include all those findings into design of our solution. As we mainly created the problem statement, we can now think what is limiting us in our solution.

Dorte- one of the Study Counseling representatives, also had a problem with setting up the meetings with students. We also set a goal for ourselves to solve this issue.
